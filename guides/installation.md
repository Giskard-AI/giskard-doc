```

## Install additional Python libraries

If you need specific Python libraries that are not pre-installed in Giskard and that are available in PyPI, git, locally etc., you can install them manually in Giskard. To do so, execute the following commands:

1. Go to `giskard/giskard-ml-worker/ml-worker.dockerfile`
2. Below the line `Add your python dependencies here` , write the following line:&#x20;

```bash
RUN poetry add <YOUR LIBRARY> #With Poetry you can add libraries hosted locally, Github, PyPI, etc. See: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add etc
```

&#x20; 3\. From the root of the Giskard directory run

```bash
docker-compose stop ml-worker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker-compose.yml build ml-worker
docker-compose up ml-worker
```

## Install a new Python version

Giskard application is working on Python 3.7, if you use another Python version (3.9 or 3.10 for instance), please follow these steps:

1. Change Python version in `giskard/giskard-ml-worker/ml-worker.dockerfile`
2. Run the following command lines

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker-compose.yml build ml-worker
docker-compose down ml-worker && docker-compose up ml-worker -d
```
